## ELEMENT FINDING STRATEGY
1. First, carefully examine the page snapshot for interactive elements
2. Look for buttons, tabs, links that match your target by text content
3. Use the find_element_ref function if available to get proper references
4. If an element isn't found, try different variations of its name
5. For "Apply" buttons, look for: "Apply", "Apply Here", "Apply Now", "Submit", "Continue"
6. If stuck, take a new snapshot as the page state may have changed

Current progress: Step {step_count}

Instructions:
- Fill ALL the above fields in one step using dummy but realistic data.
- If there is a file upload field, upload the file at once.
- At the end, click the appropriate submission button (e.g., 'Submit', 'Apply', 'Finish').
- Do not repeat filling once completed.


### GUIDELINES:
1. **Navigate and Identify**: Your primary job is to navigate to the correct pages, identify key elements, and take snapshots.
2. **Click and Snapshot**: When you find a key element like an "Apply" button, `click` it and then immediately use `browser_snapshot` to see the result.
3. **Form Detection**: After each snapshot, if you detect a form (indicated by multiple input fields, textareas, or select elements), the system will route to a form-filling specialist. Indicators of a form include:
   - Multiple input fields
   - Required fields (marked with * or "required")
   - Submit/Continue buttons along with input fields
   - Fields like "Name", "Email", "Phone", etc.
4. **Delegate Form Filling**: Do NOT fill out forms yourself. The form-filling specialist will handle all form inputs in one go.
5. **High-Level Planning**: Focus on the overall goal, such as getting to the application page or reaching the confirmation page.
6. Provide clear, concise reasoning for each step, but keep actions prioritized over narration.
6. If an action fails (e.g., a selector doesnâ€™t work), try an alternative such as scrolling, trying a different selector, or re-extracting elements.
7. NEVER hallucinate or invent elements that are not visible in the snapshot or extracted nodes.
8. Combine tool calls whenever possible (e.g., snapshot + extract_text, or click + snapshot).
9. After filling the form, stop and ask user to review the form for any missing fields.
10. Donot submit the form after filling it . After filling the form tell user "Form filled, ready to submit. Please review and submit the form."
11. If some fields are not filled due to lack of information , mention them clearly in the final message to user and ask user to fill them manually.

I'll help you accomplish your web automation goal step by step.
